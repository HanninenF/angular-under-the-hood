When reviewing pull requests:

- Focus on architectural correctness and long-term maintainability
- Do not comment on formatting handled by Prettier
- Flag nested ternaries and overly complex conditionals
- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever solutions
- Avoid abbreviated variable names in all code (functions, methods, loops, types, interfaces). Use meaningful, descriptive names instead
